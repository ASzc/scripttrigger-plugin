        Configure Jenkins to poll an environment by a script. <br/>
        You can provide a script content or a script file path. <br/>
        Script execution exit code is checked. <br/>
        If the script execution returns the expected code, a build is triggered. <br/>
        You are able to configure the exit code. By default, the exit code is evaluated to '0'. <br/>
        <br/>
        Note: You are able to inject environment variables in the script by using the envinject Jenkins plugin.
